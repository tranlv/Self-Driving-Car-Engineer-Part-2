* Project 0 - [Extended Kalman Filter](https://github.com/tranlyvu/Self-Driving-Car-Engineer-Part-2/tree/master/Extended%20Kalman%20Filter): Utilized a kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements.

* Project 1 - [Unscented Kalman Filter](https://github.com/tranlyvu/Self-Driving-Car-Engineer-Part-2/tree/master/Extended%20Kalman%20Filter): Utilized an Unscented Kalman Filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements.

* Project 2 - [Kidnapped Vehicle](https://github.com/tranlyvu/Self-Driving-Car-Engineer-Part-2/tree/master/Kidnapped%20Vehicle): Implemented a 2 dimensional particle filter in C++.

* Project 3 - [PID Control](https://github.com/tranlyvu/Self-Driving-Car-Engineer-Part-2/tree/master/PID%20Control): Implemented a PID controller in C++ to maneuver the vehicle around the track.

* Project 4 - [Model Predictive Control](https://github.com/tranlyvu/Self-Driving-Car-Engineer-Part-2/tree/master/Model_Predictive_Control): Implemented Model Predictive Control to drive the car around the track.
